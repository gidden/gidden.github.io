<h1>Random Reactor Request-Based Exchange<a class="headerlink" href="#random-reactor-request-based-exchange" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section describes the resource exchange generation for the case where
reactors are ordering fuel from suppliers. The primary goal is to discern what
are the possible options that parameterize a given instance of such an exchange
in order to test the underlying formulation under different scalings of these
parameters.</p>
<p>A request group represents a reactor fuel request where items (nodes) in that
request satisfy the same demand. For example, a fast reactor may make a request
for assemblies for its radial blanket. Such a request could include mostly
natural uranium, but a subset may be replaceable with thorium.</p>
<p>A variety of parameters are required to described an instance of a resource
exchange where reactors request fuel. The sum of these parameters define the
state of the exchange, which is comprised of both supply and request groups and
individual nodes within those groups. A parameter either represents a constant
value for each group it parameterizes or it represents an average value,
distribution, and related information, and the group-specific value is sampled
for each run of that ^instance^ of the exchange. As may be expected, average
values are used in cases where it does not make sense for the system state in
question to be modeled as constant across the entire system. For example, since
request nodes roughly model the number of assemblies being ordered by a reactor,
it makes more sense for this to be an average value rather than a static
value. By using an average value, the model provides insight into cases where
most reactors order ^around^ that many assemblies. In general, constant values
are preferred, in order to reduce the overall number of runs required to achieve
representable analytics.</p>
<p>It should be noted that representing a resource exchange is inherently
stochastic. Take for instance a resource exchange where not every possible arc
exists (i.e., there is a supplier of a commodity that is not connected to a
consumer), the degree of which is measured by the connection probabilty
parameter. In such cases, which suppliers and consumers must be chosen
arbitrarily, an inherently random process.</p>

to an assembly-type fueling system. Generally, each assembly corresponds to a
node in the exchange graph. If an assembly can be satisfied by multiple
commodities, multiple exchange nodes will be added while the subsequent demand
constraint remains the same.</p>
<p>It is likely that this parameter will be sampled bimodally &#8211; in small numbers
(i.e., 1 - 3) to model batch-type reactors and in large numbers (40 - 65). The
large number scaling is indicative of a range for an AP1000 operating in a

<p>Supply constraint values drive the mass flow with respect to whether flow comes
from actual suppliers or the ^faux^ suppliers (in order to guarantee a feasible
solution). The total amount needed to fully supply for a commodity can be known
after the demands for that commodity are formulated. Accordingly, an optimal
solution that does not involve faux suppliers can be achieved by setting the
supply constraint value for each supplier equal to that total demand.</p>
<p>A number of effects will be investigated for both unit capacities of unity and
random values:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a single supply constraint per supplier set at sufficient supply</li>
<li>a single supply constraint per supplier set at less-than sufficient supply
(e.g., 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 of sufficient supply)</li>
<li>multiple supply constraints, one of which is set at less than sufficient
supply</li>
<li>multiple supply constraints, more than one of which is set at less than
sufficient supply</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of these experiements is to determine the effect of constrained supply
on the solution of the multicommodity formulation and the effect of more than
one constraint enforcing that effect. It is assumed that the effect of less-than
sufficient constraints will manifest with the first such constraint but will not
increase with subsequent additions.</p>

<p>Because the coefficients will depend on the process being modeled, e.g.,
enrichment, separations, etc., the actual translation function that produces
such coefficients can be wide ranging. Similarly, demand translation functions
can be wide ranging. However, a basic assumption is made that the relation
between the unit capacity coefficients and capacitating value is approximately
the same for demand constraints and supply constraints in the same ^class^
