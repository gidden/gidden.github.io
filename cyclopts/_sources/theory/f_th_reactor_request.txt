Fast/Thermal Reactor Request-Based Exchange
============================================

The primary criticism agaisnt a random assignment of commodities, preference
coefficients, and constraint coefficients is that using domain-specific models
provides specific structure to a given formulation. This problem species is
designed to target a specific set of cases that focus randomness in the
domain-related values and defines domain-specific translations from those values
to the associated coefficients.

Model Fidelity
--------------

Furthermore, this species is specifically targeted at investigating the effects
of model fidelity on a given formulation. Eight different fidelity "levels" have
been defined in three categories.

===================  =====================================
Category             Subcategory
===================  =====================================
Facilities           - Reactor Requests (batch/assem)

                     - Supply Constraints (inv/inv + process)
-------------------  -------------------------------------
Fuel Cycle           - Once-Through

                     - UOX + MOX F/Th Recycle

                     - UOX + MOX F/Th Recycle + Thorium F Recycle
-------------------  -------------------------------------
Geospatial           - None

                     - Coarse
		     
                     - Fine
===================  =====================================

Commodities
-----------

There are four possible commodities based on the fuel cycle fidelity modeled:

* enriched UOX
* fast MOX
* thermal MOX
* fast ThOX

Facilities
---------------

In order to allow for rapid instance generation, surrogate models of facilties
must be used. Surrogate models simplify the decision making that would normally
occur in agent archetypes. The goal of using surrogate models is provide
instances generally domain-valid structure.

Material
++++++++

All surrogate facility models require a notion of materials. Because simplicity
is required, materials have two properties: a commodity and fertile
enrichment. Certain commodities are fungible, e.g., fast and thermal
plutonium. Fungible commodities are delineated by preference assignment and
supplier process coefficients, both of which described in the following
sections.

Reactors
++++++++

request enrichment and commod_{i, j}

enr per request

recycled fraction for thermal reactors

Supporting Facilities
+++++++++++++++++++++

conversion functions, rhs equation

Fuel Cycles
-----------

More commodities are required to model more complex fuel cycles. Similarly, as
more fungible commodities are added a given instance of the GFCTP becomes more
complex. This species of the GFCTP can add fuel cycle, and therefore commodity,
complexity in three steps.

Once Through
++++++++++++

The least complex fuel cycle is the Once Through (OT) fuel cycle. Reactors
request enriched uranium, and supporting facilities are represented by
Enrichment Fuel Fabricators.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

None

Recycle
+++++++

Next, a Recycle (R) scenario is considered. Thermal and fast reactors are
included, and a ratio between the two is set as a parameter. Supporting
facilities include Enrichment, Thermal, and Fast Fuel Fabricators. The amount of
thermal reactors requests that can be satisfied by recycled fuel is set as a
parameter.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

    :math:`f_{t, f}` : the fraction of thermal reactors to fast reactors

    :math:`f_{re}` : the fraction of thermal reactor requests that can be met
    with recycled fuel

Questions
~~~~~~~~~

* Should suppliers be treated similarly to reactors (i.e., :math:`f_{t, f}`)?
  This increases the parameter space by :math:`n - 1` dimensions.

Recycle + Thorium
+++++++++++++++++

Finally, a fuel cycle with a thorium breeder reactor is modeled. Building on the
R scenario, the Recycle + Thorium (RTh) adds an additional fast reactor model
that prefers Thorium-based recycled fuel. The fraction of fast reactors that are
Thorium-based is set as a parameter. Additionally, a Thorium Fast Fuel
Fabricator is added to the pool of suppliers.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

    :math:`f_{th, pu}` : the fraction of fast reactors that are Thorium-based

Geospatial Assignment
---------------------

Geospatial values can be assigned in either a coarse or fine fashion. In both
cases, a location proxy is assigned uniformly, e.g., on :math:`[0,
1]`. Locations are binned, representing regions. If coarse, only regional
relationships are taken into account; if fine, regional relationships are taken
into account as well as total proximity.

Once geospatial values are assigned, they can then affect preferences. A
surrogate model function is required, and one suggestion is 

.. math::

   p_{l}(i, j) = \delta_{l} \frac{\exp(- | reg_{i} - reg_{j} | ) + \delta_{fine} \exp(- \| loc_{i} - loc_{j} \| )}{1 + \delta_{fine}}  

Parameters
++++++++++

    :math:`\delta_{l}` : whether to include a location preference 

    :math:`\delta_{fine}` : whether to include a fine location proxy 

    :math:`n_{reg}` : the number of regions

Surrogate Models
++++++++++++++++

    :math:`p_{l}(i, j)` : location-based preference

Preference Determination
------------------------

Given that facilities have preference assignments based on commodity matching
and, optionally, a valid question is whether the formulation is affected by
their relative magnitude. Therefore a final parameter is added to determine the
total preference

.. math::

    p(i, j) = p_{c}(i, j) + r_{l, c} p_{l}(i, j)

Parameters
++++++++++

    :math:`r_{l, c}` : the importance ratio of location to commodity types
