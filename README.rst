Notes
=====

The `original
<http://www.styleshout.com/hits.php?id=35&url=templates/downloads/Ceevee10.zip>_`
version from `styleshout http://www.styleshout.com/>_` had a couple of other
cool out-of-the-box features that weren't necessary for a first-blush
implementation. They could easily be reimplemented by either uncommenting them
in `index.html` or pulling the desired blocks out of
`boilerplate/index.html`. Note that the original `layout.css` also lives in
`boilerplate/layout.css`.
